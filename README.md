# 🏬 Store Management System
📜 Project Overview
The Store Management System is a Python-based application that provides a simple yet powerful interface for managing a retail store's operations. It connects seamlessly with a MySQL database to manage inventory, customer, and employee records efficiently.

This system is designed for two types of users:

Employees (Shop Staff)

Customers (Shoppers)

It allows employees to manage stock and administrative tasks, while customers can browse and place orders with ease through a user-friendly, menu-driven program.
